# Python Practice Repository

This repository contains Python files that I have created while working through the exercises, incorporating examples from YouTube tutorials and the book "A Smarter Way to Learn Python" by Mark Myers as part of my Python programming practice and learning journey.

I have utilized multiple learning sources to enhance my Python skills:

- YouTube Tutorials: For visual and step-by-step guidance.
- Stack Overflow: For troubleshooting and learning from community-driven solutions.
- "A Smarter Way to Learn Python" by Mark Myers: For structured learning and hands-on practice exercises.

## Repository Contents

The repository includes Python scripts covering various topics from the book, such as:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- Modules
- File Handling
- Error Handling
- Object-Oriented Programming
- and more...

## Getting Started

To run the Python files in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

Once you have Python installed, you can run any of the scripts using the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python filename.py
